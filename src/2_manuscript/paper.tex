\subsection*{Clearing the Infection}
The level of protection provided by the KIR system depends on the viral cariant the individual is infected with. If a host is infected with a wild type virus, the infection will be cleared with a certain probability due to an assumed T- and NK-cell response. A virus that is able to down-regulate the expression of MHC class I escapes the immune response of T cells. Therefore, this virus type will be clared with a lower probability than the wild type virus. A virus evolving decoy MHC decoys is detected via the KIRs as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item If there is only an inhibitory signal (i.e. the decoy binds only to an iKIR but it doesn't bind to any aKIR wihtin an individual or there are no aKIR in that individual), the decoy virus will successfully escape NK cell response and the infection will not be cleared.
\item If there is only an activating signal (i.e. the iKIR does not recognize the decoy as self MHC or that host does not have any iKIRs), the individual has protection provided by the NK cells and the infection will be subsequentially be clared with the same probability as an MHC downregulating virus. 
\item If there is neither an activating nor an inhibiting signal, MHC down-regulation will be detected by the iKIRs in that host, and the infection will be cleared accordingly.
\item If there are both signals, the decoy is being detected by the aKIR. Hence, the individual will be protected by the NK cells. 
\end{itemize}



Note that we do not model an accumulation of activating and inhibiting signaling, but we consider an NK cell to become activated and thus provide protection whenever the balance of inhibitory/activating signals is disrupted, either by engagement of iKIR, or aKIR, or both.
